### v2.1.0

- Modified the WebWizardPAS to be smarter about using the provides Service URI value to place BE classes within an additional subdirectory.
- | Only works when the path is prefixed as "/web/pdo" and is not referring to a "common" directory.
- | The 3rd URL element will become the new directory for your BE, and should reflect the name of the service to which that entity should belong.
- Fixed the menu logic in the wizard to update the correct file (and report the full path) after adding a UI screen.
- Added support for selecting a ProDataset as your schema object for a new Business Entity (requires selection of a matching DB table).
- Added support for custom Service URI, which affects the location of the generated BE and related class property.
- Began adding support for versioning of API's (requires a change to catalog.json config file).
- Fixed issue in catalog logic that would not allow schema with a CLOB to be exposed.
- Remove code that threw errors in OEUserRealm class, instead return appropriate values.
- MAJOR BUGFIX: Clean up CP handles due to memory leak in GetClientPrincipal() calls!

- Added initial support for new features in forthcoming JSDO Catalog version.
- Fixed various memory leaks (uncleaned DS/TT handles) leftover in memory when session is ended.
- Updated the vendor libraries, including jQuery and KendoUI.


### v1.4.0

- Added new PASOE projects (ABL Web App) to demonstrate both local code execution and a distributed environment (PASOE-Web for DMZ/Gateway, PASOE-APSV for logic).
- Added new parameter for facades to accept a path value representing the service being requested.
- | This allows for service, resource, and method to uniquely identify the code to be invoked.
- | It also provides namespacing of the registered BE classes to work only with a specific service entry point.
- | This is mainly for security purposes, since the front- end URL’s are already secured by path/service.
- Added ability to pass back a JSON object consisting of name/value pairs via the MessageManager, which can be headers for the web handler for WS- PAS.
- | This allows for custom headers to be set on the framework side and output automatically within the transport layer.
- Track the real resource (class) and method within the ConfigManager during dynamic invocation, so that any back- end code that needs to know the true values can access them.
- Add new facade classes to handle local or remote data execution, and to allow calling via an AppServer (PASOE- APSV).
- Return a standard error (502 Bad Gateway) when remote AppServer is unavailable (for use with RemoteFacade).
- Streamlined logging from Spark startup (dynamic resources, etc.) to make logs easier to read.
- Added better logging features to the Manager base class and implementation classes.
- Created a new dynamic resource interface/class without default CRUD/Submit methods (for non- JSDO use).
- | This new IDynamicResource/DynamicResource combo continues to work within the CatalogManager alongside the IDynamicEntity/DynamicEntity combo.
- | The difference is that a DynamicResource does not contain any data methods, and expects all defined methods to become invokes.
- | It can still report itself to the catalog and should be capable of being called like any other invoke method via the JSDO.
- Added ability to use separate config directories when using a multi-webapp PASOE instance.
- Enhanced the ConnectionManager class to track session context data, and to allow reconnecting to a server.
- Added a configuration file for handlers, allowing them to use either Direct or Remote facade. If using a Remote facade, allow setting of a default server and remote procedure to be run.
- Enhanced connection manager to support a new procedure handle as part of a remote AppServer connection.
- Added example of streaming a binary file back to the client using PASOE- WS.
- Modified wizard and framework to allow changing the idProperty value in generated catalogs.
- | This is the value that is used by the generated schema to hold the RowID of each record, as required by the JSDO for paging and other operations.
- | This is set via the JSON config files (wizard.json, catalog.json).
- Adjusted the way a generated catalog reports its URI, which affects the (newly added) logic for handling per- service resources.
- Changed URL prefix of "si" to "pdo" to better match the pattern from engineering, and to standardize on the name of "Progress Data Object" when referring to web- enabled business entities.
- Added example of a modal (Quick Menu) on the application header, ala. functionality from the old Evolution demo.
- Renamed the new- ish WebServiceInterface to SparkHandler (still abstract), to better illustrate its purpose as an inherited class for the other WebHandler classes.
- Removed all code that was sealing (or creating) the anonymous CP token, removed related config file and config- reading logic.
- Added a new RouteManager to handle dynamic location of Business Entities, now hands off to ServiceManager only to start the entity (which itself is a service).
- Refactored catalog requests to go through same RouteManager and execute via the same interface as all other requests.
- Simplified the initial WebHandler classes created for the project into a single DataObjectHandler that utilizes the new RouteManager and condensed runService call.


### v1.3.0

- Prepare for use with PASOE by adding some sample handlers (JSDO + Catalog).
- Created new facade for use with Web Handlers (PASOE WebSpeed).

### v1.1.0

- Integrated use of a JSDO catalog with wizard on the front-end for UI generation.
- Provided sample integration with Corticon for rules, using both an ABL and AJAX approach.
- Updated color scheme to prepare for the coming company changes in 2016 (no logo used at present).
