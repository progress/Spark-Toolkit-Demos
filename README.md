# Progress Spark Toolkit Demo Projects

### Welcome!

This repository contains sample projects ready for import into PDSOE and PASOE, meant to illustrate usage of the **Progress Spark Toolkit**. Please note that all demos are for illustrating server-side micro-services only; there are no UI components bundled as of the December 2020 release (v6.0.0).

**Note:** This release utilizes toolkit release [v6.0.0](https://github.com/progress/Spark-Toolkit/releases/tag/v6.0.0).

## Requirements

**OpenEdge 11.7.6** or **OpenEdge 12.2.0** at minimum, **OpenEdge 11.7.8+** or **OpenEdge 12.2.3+** preferred, with the **Spark.pl** library compiled on your appropriate version (11 or 12).

- Apache Ant 1.9.x+ (included as of OE 11.7+ at DLC/ant and run as DLC/bin/proant)
- Progress Compile Tools, or "PCT" (included as of OE 11.7.3 at DLC/pct/PCT.jar)

## Installation / Setup

Utilize the projects from the same folder as your major version of OpenEdge to maintain consistency with the project metadata as expected by **Progress Developer Studio for OpenEdge**. Import the desired project via `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`.

To provide sample data you may use the provided database structure, schema, and table data from `/support/schema/` to create the necessary **Sports2020** and **WebState** databases. To speed up this process on Windows, you can run `ant create` to create and load the databases in a `C:\Databases` folder (use the `-Dpath` option to choose an alternate location).

**Note:** For compatibility with the security mechanisms in place within the application, each database must be pre-loaded with the necessary domain data. For each database, use the Data Administration tool to import Domain security via the supplied `_sec-authentication-domain.d` file in each database folder under `/support/schema/`. Note that the correct authentication domain file must agree with the version of OpenEdge as security passcode hashes changed between versions 11 and 12.

## PAS Deployment

Each demo is an "ABL Web App" project meant to work within a PAS instance. To make the setup process quick, there is an Ant build script in each project's "AppServer" directory. Simply running `ant create` will create a suitable PAS instance at a predetermined location (C:\PASOE) and automatically include the proper PROPATH entries and files to start the instance.
