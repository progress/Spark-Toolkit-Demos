This directory is for SAML Service provider & Identity Provider Metadata files.
No other things should/can be deployed in this directory.

SAML metadata is an XML document which contains information necessary for interaction with SAML -enabled identity or service providers.  
The document contains e.g. URLs of endpoints, information about supported bindings, identifiers and public keys. 
Typically one metadata document will be generated for your own service provider and sent to all identity providers you want to enable single sign-on with. 
Similarly, each identity provider will make its own metadata available for you to import into your service provider application.

*Service Provider metadata file can be create by direct modification or you can make your application to generate service provider metadata file for you. 
(As PAS is not direct login to IDP, so that you could use same SP metadata file that you have created for the PAS client, which configured with
 SAML to handle redirect & direct login with IDP)

*Identity Provider metadata file can be downloaded from configured IdP and put inside your service provider to validate incoming SAML asseration.
