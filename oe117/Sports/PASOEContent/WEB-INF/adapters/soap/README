This README describes contents of the parent folder "soap". The contents
of parent "soap" folder is used by the runtime to initialize SOAP transport
for the oeabl service. The [.wsad, .wsdl, .props] files are per-soap-service
and are created by the SOAP transport runtime during the deployment process
as explained later.

1) DeployedServices.ds
   Binary file containing all the deployed SOAP service definitions.
   Used by SOAP runtime to create and manage endpoints. DO NOT DELETE.

2) default.props
   Property file containing default values of runtime properties.
   Each deployed SOAP service will inherit property values for its own copy
   of runtime properties from this file.

3) <ServiceName>.wsad [WSAD]
   Web Service Application Descriptor.
   The file contains the soap services definitions and the mapping information
   for the soap request and response with the appserver application.

4) <ServiceName>.wsdl [WSDL]
   Web Services Description Language.
   The file contains the web services definition information. The
   Application Programmer ( soap service consumer ) uses the WSDL file
   to create client interface based on the WSDL.

5) <ServiceName>.props [PROPERTY]
   Runtime Property file.
   The file contains configurable runtime properties for connection with
   the PAS Server. The property is per application so that each service
   can independently cofigure the way it talks to the Application Server.


Deploying a WSM (Web Service Mapping) in an OEABL Appliction for PAS Server.
===========================================================================

The WSM maps the Progress 4GL procedures that run on the Application Server.
Deployment of WSM can be performed using:

1) deploySOAP.sh/deploySOAP.bat utility:

   - The utility reside in the PAS instance's bin folder i.e. {CATALINA_BASE}/bin.

   - General syntax to deploy a wsm is:
     Examples:
       Deploy test.wsm to OEABL WebApp named ROOT
       # $CATALINA_BASE/bin/deploySOAP.sh /tmp/test.wsm ROOT

       Undeploy an existing SOAP service named test from OEABL WebApp ROOT
       # $CATALINA_BASE/bin/deploySOAP.sh test ROOT -undeploy

   - While using the utility ensure that the SOAP transport is ENABLED for the
     target OEABL Service

   - Once deployed, the above mentioned files [.props, .wsad, .wsdl] will be
     created in the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/<OEABL WebApp>/WEB-INF/adapters/soap


2) REST webservice call to oemanager webapp:

   - oemanager webapp serves as a central utility to manage OEABL webapps.

   - General syntax to deploy a wsm is:
     Examples: ( using curl client. You may wish to use any HTTP client )
       Deploy test.wsm to OEABL WebApp named ROOT
        # curl -X POST --data-binary @test.wsm
        # http://<PASHostName>:<PASPortNum>/oemanager/applications/<InstanceName>/webapps/ROOT/transports/soap/oeservices
        # -H "Accept: application/vnd.progress+json"
        # -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.progress.wsm+xml"
        # -H "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=test.wsm" -v

       Undeploy an existing SOAP service named test from OEABL WebApp ROOT
        # curl -X POST
        # http://<PASHostName>:<PASPortNum>/oemanager/applications/<InstanceName>/webapps/ROOT/transports/soap/oeservices/test

   - While using the utility ensure that the SOAP transport is ENABLED for the
     target OEABL Service

   - Once deployed, the above mentioned files [.props, .wsad, .wsdl] will be
     created in the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/<OEABL WebApp>/WEB-INF/adapters/soap
