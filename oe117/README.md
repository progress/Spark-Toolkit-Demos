# Framework Demo Projects


## PASOE Projects (Type: ABL Web App)

**Sports** - Demonstrates use of the built-in DataObjectHandler (DOH) included with 11.6.3 and later, using statically-produced service mapping files from PDSOE. There is no UI for this application.

**DynSports** - Similar to the Sports project, but uses runtime discovery of classes to create necessary metadata for the DOH pattern. There is no UI for this application.

## Other Projects

**QuickStart** - Not a project, per-se, but more like an overlay of project properties and extra files to get you started quickly with a new PAS-compatible ABL Web App project. This will provide the necessary PL files for use with Spark, set the PROPATH accordingly, and add the metadata for a defined service called DataObjectService which sets up a generic use of the DOH to expose endpoints.
