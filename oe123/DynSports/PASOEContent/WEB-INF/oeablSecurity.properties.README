 # Spring Security bean properties definition file for all oeabl.war based
 # web applications found in a PAS for OE instance. The properties values found
 # in this file constitute the full set of Spring Security configuration
 # properties and their values.
 #
 # Hierarchy of .properties files:
 # PAS for OE resolves property settings by loading multiple .properties
 # files and by using the first declared value it finds.  The .properties
 # files are loaded in this order:
 #
 #     1) webapps/<web-app-name>/WEB-INF/oeablSecurity.properties
 #        In this file, declare the properties and value that are web
 #        application specific and override the properties defined in the
 #        PAS for OE /conf and ablapps/<abl-app-name> property files.
 #
 #     2) ablapps/<abl-app-name>/oeablSecurity.properties
 #        In this file, declare ABL business application specific
 #        properties and values that will override any settings in
 #        the /conf properties files.
 #
 #        Note: ablapps/<abl-app-name>/oeablSecurity.properties is optional
 #        and will not produce an error if it is not present.
 #        Also note that the default ABL business web application name
 #        generated on creation of a PAS for OE instance is the same as
 #        the instance's alias name.
 #
 #     3) conf/oeablSecurity.properties
 #        In this file, declare the properties and values that span
 #        all abl/web applications in the PAS for OE instance.
 #
 # PAS for OE must find at least one oeablSecurity.properties file in one
 # of the locations listed above.
 #
 # Specifying properties and values:
 # The properties and their values follow the Java properties file format,
 # where each line contains a single property-name and property-value
 # separated by and equals-sign delimiter.
 #
 #  Rules:
 #  o Property values are generally set in hierarchical name-spaces,
 #    where the outer-most parent space names precede child space names
 #    and spaces are delimited by a period. For example:
 #
 #      name=value
 #
 #      space1.name=value
 #
 #      space1.child1space.name=value
 #      space1.child2space.name=value
 #
 #      space2.child1space.name=value
 #      space2.child2space.name=value
 #
 #  o Any whitespace between beginning of line and the first character,
 #    and between the last character and the equals-sign delimiter is
 #    ignored.
 #
 #  o Names may NOT have embedded whitespace between the first and last
 #    characters of the name.
 #
 #  o Names are CASE-SENSITIVE, per the Spring Security definition.
 #
 #  o Names must be unique.
 #
 #  o Property-value types may be: { String | boolean | integer }
 #
 #    String property-values:
 #    o May be blank, signified by a carriage control after the equals-sign
 #      delimiter.
 #
 #    o May have a value that begins with the character following the equals-sign
 #      delimiter and extending to the line termination carriage-control.
 #
 #    o May not include double-quote or single-quote characters, unless otherwise
 #      specified in the property description.
 #
 #    o Some may contain comma separated values.  Refer to the property
 #      description.
 #
 #    o Most properties are case-sensitive unless otherwise specified in the
 #      property-name description
 #
 #    Boolean property values:
 #    o May have a value of { true | false }.
 #
 #    o May not use O/1, yes/no, or other boolean forms.
 #
 #    o Must have a value.
 #
 #    o May not be enclosed in single or double quotation characters.
 #
 #    Integer property values:
 #    o May be positive, negative, or zero, as specified by their
 #      property-name description.
 #
 #    o Must have a value.
 #
 #    o May not be enclosed in single or double quotation marks.
 #
 #  Property-values may be recursively 'mapped' to another property. This
 #  provides the ability to configure various components individually
 #  and yet make it easier to set them all using one property.  To map a
 #  property-value to another property's value, refer to the property-name
 #  whose value is to be used by enclosing like this: ${<property-name>}
 #  For example:
 #      component.all=value1
 #          ...
 #      component1=${component.all}
 #      component2=${component.all}
 #
 #  The resulting property values are:
 #      component1=value1
 #      component2=value1
 #
 # The convention for sections in this file is:

############# Rollbase SSO Filter #############################################
## Authentication filter used for Rollbase SSO integration, where Rollbase
## produces a SSO token that it sends to OpenEdge in a custom HTTP header field.
## The filter decodes and validates the SSO token and creates a
## Client-Principal filter that is delivered to the ABL business application
## code.
##
## By default this filter is disabled, if any user is already authenticated or
## authorized by Rollbase then it skips all the authentication configurations
## and directly accesses the OpenEdge services after validation
##
##  To turn on Rollbase SSO :
##    1. Set "enabled" property to true
##    2. Supply the absolute path of a 'registryFile'
##       generated using OpenEdge's $DLC/bin/gendomreg.bat utility as
##       "registryFile" property

 that is used to prefix each Rollbase SSO token's role field name so
 that it can be used in Spring Security's URL intercept-url access controls.
 [ROLE_]

preauthAuthProvider.enabledAttrName: A non-blank case-sensitive String name
 used to query the Rollbase SSO token's account-enabled field and use it
 to allow only enabled accounts access to the web service.
 [ATTR_ENABLED]

 used to query the Rollbase SSO token's account-locked field and use it
 to allow only enabled accounts access to the web service.
 [ATTR_LOCKED]

preauthAuthProvider.expiredAttrName: A non-blank case-sensitive String name
 used to query the Rollbase SSO token's account-expired field and use it
 to allow only enabled accounts access to the web service.
 [ATTR_EXPIRED]


############# OEClientPrincipalFilter bean #####################################
## The OEClientPrincipalFilter bean turns a Spring token, holding the
## authenticated user's information, into an OpenEdge ClientPrincipal object.
## The filter is thus responsible for:
##  1. Creating a ClientPrincipal object if one was not created in a previous
##     security process authentication step
##  2. If the previous authentication process produced a Spring token,
##     copy that information into the ClientPrincipal
##  3. If the ClientPrincipal is not already sealed, seal it using this
##     filter's domain and registry configuration
##  4. If enablecp is true, send the ClientPrincipal to the ABL business
##     logic

OEClientPrincipalFilter.enabled: A boolean value that enables/disables the
 production and passing of a Client-Principal to the ABL business application.
 [true]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.registryFile: The String file path of where to
 find and load an OEDomain Registry file that holds multiple access-code
 values for validating Rollbase produced SSO tokens.  Used when Rollbase
 produces SSO tokens for multiple OpenEdge tenants.
 []

OEClientPrincipalFilter.domain: A case-insensitive String value that
 specifies the OpenEdge Domain name to append to the Spring Security
 authenticated user-id in the event the user-id is not a fully qualified
 OpenEdge user name.  A blank value will designate using the default
 OpenEdge blank OE Domain name.
 []

OEClientPrincipalFilter.roles: An optional case-sensitive String value
 holding a comma separated list of Spring Secuirty/ABL application Role
 names that will be inserted into a Client-Principal.  When blank no
 additional Role information will be inserted into the Client-Principal
 and all Roles used for Spring Security URL access controls and/or ABL
 business application must come from the authenticated user's account
 properties.
 []

OEClientPrincipalFilter.authz: A boolean value that when true will load
 the Spring Security token's authorized Role list (obtained from the
 authenticated user account's properties) into the Client-Principal's
 Role attribute.
 [true]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.expires: An integer value that sets the Client-Principal
 object's expiration time.  The value range is 0 to n, where a 0 value
 indicates no expiration will be set.
 [0]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.accntinfo: A boolean value that when true will
 load the Spring Security token's account state information (i.e. enabled,
 locked, expired,...) into the Client-Principal's properties.
 [false]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.ccid: A boolean value that when true will return
 the authenticated user's HTTP [login] session id as an HTTP response
 header.  The header will only be returned in an HTTP response at the
 time a successful authentication has completed.  Note: Spring Security
 controls all user login sessions and their IDs.
 [false]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.anonymous: A boolean value that when true will
 produced an unsealed Client-Principal object for the anonymous (i.e.
 unauthenticated) client and pass it to the ABL business application.
 [false]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.sealAnonymous: A boolean value that when true
 will add sealing a Client-Principal object produced when the
 OEClientPrincipalFilter.anonymous property is enabled.  This property
 is ignored if OEClientPrincipalFilter.anonymous is disabled.
 [false]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.appName: A non-blank String value that is used as
 the OpenEdge Domain name when an unqualified client user name is authenticated
 by Spring Security and is not derived from the authenticated user's
 Role list (see property OEClientPrincipalFilter.domainRoleFilter).
 [OE]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.passthru: A boolean value that when true will generate
 and pass to the ABL business application an unsealed Client-Principal object
 that represents an unauthenticated client user name.
 [false]

OEClientPrincipalFilter.domainRoleFilter: An optional String value that when
 non-blank will be used to derive an OpenEdge Domain name to assign to a
 Spring Security authenticated user.  Obtaining the OpenEdge Domain name is
 only used when the authenticated client user-id is not already a fully
 qualified OpenEdge user name.  The value is a Java regular expression pattern
 that is used to scan the authenticated user's granted Role names for a
 match and extract the Role name substring that represents the OpenEdge
 Domain name.  When the property is blank, authenticated user Role names
 will not be used to obtain an OpenEdge Domain name.
 []

OEClientPrincipalFilter.loadAccntAttrList: An optional String value that when
 non-blank will be used to load attributes from either a LDAP/AD user account,

 or JWT (OAuth2) token, into Client-Principal properties.
 If not specified the default action will take place:

     JWT	 load all JWT token claims loaded by the JWT token validator
 When specified, the list of names must be specfied as a wildcard asterisk

 character or a comma delimited list with no leading, trailling, or embedded

 whitespace.  Any name specified that is not found will be ignored.
      *       load all attributes defined in LDAP/AD account

## Properties for the OEAuthnSuccessHandler bean (see authFilters.xml)
## The OEAuthnSuccessHandler bean interfaces with the OE ClientPrincipal SSO
## token producer OESSOTokenManager after a successful user login.  The
## OESSOTokenManager produces a sealed OECP token that is returned to the
## client in the body of the HTTP response.
##
OEAuthnSuccessHandler.tokenErrorDetail: The amount of error detail to return
 to the client if a user is successfully authenticated, but an error occurs
 in creating the OpenEdge SSO token.   See OESSO.error.detail
 [${OESSO.error.detail}]

 [${OESSO.require.https}]

## Properties for the OEAuthnFailureHandler (see authFilters.xml)
## The OEAuthnFailureHandler is called when a user account validation fails.

OEAuthnFailureHandler.tokenErrorDetail: The amount of error detail to
 return to the client if user authentication fails during an OpenEdge
 SSO process.  See OESSO.error.detail
 [${OESSO.error.detail}]

## Properties for the OEFormEntryPoint bean (see authFilters.xml)
## The OEFormEntryPoint bean is invoked when a HTTP request requires user login
## services and an OpenEdge SSO token to be generated and returned.
## It interfaces with the OESSOTokenManager bean to determine if an
## SSO, JSON, or HTML  type of reponse message is returned.

OEFormEntryPoint.tokenErrorDetail: The amount of error detail to return to
 a client when form user login fails as part of an OpenEdge SSO token
 authentication process. See OESSO.error.detail
 [${OESSO.error.detail}]

## Properties for the OESSOTokenManager bean (see authFilters.xml)
## The OESSOTokenManager bean is the primary component for the verification
## and generation of OECP SSO tokens.  The OESSOTokenManager works in a
## supporting role for other Spring filter beans that are actively involved
## in the HTTP request authentication process.
##
OESSOTokenManager.tokenPolicy: A non-blank, case-insensitive, string value
 { disabled | ifRequired | always } that controls the generation and return
 of OpenEdge SSO tokens after a successful user authentication.
    disabled    Never return a SSO token
    ifRequired  Return a SSO token only if the client asks for one by
                passing a URL query option (see ssoTokenURLOption property)
    always      Always generate and return a SSO token after successful
                user authentication
 [disabled]

OESSOTokenManager.ssoTokenURLOption: A non-blank, case-insensitive, string
 value that holds the HTTP URL query option name that a client uses to
 request a SSO token returned after a successful user authentication.  This
 property is ignored if the tokenPolicy is disabled or always.
 [OECP]

OESSOTokenManager.ssoTokenExpires: A non-zero positive integer value that
 holds the number of seconds a SSO token will be valid after it is
 initially issued.  After the specified time elapses, the SSO token may not be used
 until it is replaced or refreshed.  This time value is only effective the
 first time a SSO token is generated.
 [3600]

OESSOTokenManager.ssoAllowScope: An optional, case-insensitive, comma-separated
 list of string values that is checked by a SSO token consumer to ensure the
 SSO token used to gain service access has been granted by the producer of the
 SSO token.  Used with the ssoGrantScope to support multiple SSO token producers,
 it limits which services those tokens may be used to access.   When blank, no
 Scope checking is performed by the SSO token consumer.
 []

OESSOTokenManager.ssoGrantScope:  An optional, case-insensitive, comma-separated
 list of string values that is granted (i.e. embedded) to a SSO token when it is
 initially created after user authentication.  It is used in conjunction with
 the ssoAllowScope consumer setting. When blank, no Scope grants are included in
 the SSO token.
 []

OESSOTokenManager.ssoTokenRefresh: A boolean value that when true issues
 a refresh token to the client at the same time an SSO token is initially issued.
 Refresh tokens never expire once issued.  When a refresh token is not returned
 to a client the SSO token's total lifetime is controlled using ssoTokenExpires.
 Refresh tokens are only honored by the same PAS for OE web application that
 issued it.
 [true]

OESSOTokenManager.ssoRefreshDeltaTime: A non-zero positive integer value that
 holds the number of seconds a refreshed SSO token will be valid for.
 After this amount of time the SSO token may not be used until it is replaced
 or refreshed.  This time value is ignored if the ssoTokenRefresh is false
 [3600]

OESSOTokenManager.springRolePrefix: An optional, case-sensitive, string value
 used as a Role name prefix in the event the Spring Security authentication
 process has not supplied prefixed Role names.  A blank value disables prefixes.
 []


## Properties for the OESSOFilter bean (see authFilters.xml)
## The OESSOFilter bean is added to the HTTP authentication process
## to look for an HTTP [Authorization] header that contains an OECP SSO token.
## If no header and token is found, it passes control to the next step
## in the authentication process.  If a header and token is found it will
## use the OESSOTokenManager to extract, verify, and convert the OECP

## OAuth2 Resource server configuration
## An OAuth2 Resource server provides data-services for client applications.
## The client application sends an "access token" obtained from an OAuth2
## Authorization server, which the Resource server must validate before it is
## accepted.  Validation involves obtaining a JWT token that can be validated
## by the Resource server and its "claims" used to perform URL access control
## to the Resource service's data-services.  The JWT may be obtained as a
## "self-contained" access token or by using the access token as an indirect
## reference to a JWT stored in the issuing Authorization server.

## OpenEdge Authentication Gateway client configuration
## for direct user logins to a PAS for OE server
##
sts.AuthProvider.multiTenant: A boolean value that when true allows the
user-id being authenticated to contain an ampersand '@' and OpenEdge Domain
name. When false a user-id containing an ampersand is not allowed.
[true]

sts.AuthProvider.userDomain: A case-insensitive string that provides the
OpenEdge Domain name to append to the user-id being authenticated.  If
multiTenant property is true, the Domain name is appended only if the
user-id being authenticated does not already specify a Domain name. A blank

the OpenEdge supplemental documentation to get a list of valid cipher-suite
names used for a Java OpenClient.
[]

sts.UserDetails.tlsProtocols: Use this property to explicitly specify a
comma delimited list of TLS protocol version names the client will use when
connecting to an OE Authentication Gateway server's HTTPS port.  The default
