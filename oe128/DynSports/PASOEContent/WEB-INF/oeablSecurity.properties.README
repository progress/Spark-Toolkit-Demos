---------------------- oeablSecurity.properties.README -------------------------
The oeablSecurity.properties file found in an oeabl web application's WEB-INF/
directory holds configuration property values that are specific to the web
application.  Properties not defined in this web application's 
oeablSecurity.properties file are inherited from the full version found in
the PAS for OE instance's conf/ directory.

The PAS for OE instance's conf/oeablSecurity.properties file holds a full set 
of properties and their default values.  In the same conf/ directory is the
oeablSecurity.properties.README that describes the full set of properties 
supported by the instance.

You are free to copy property definitions from the conf/ directory's
oeablSecurity.properties file into this web application's version to explicitly
define the property.  You may also remove a property from the web application's
oeablSecurity.properties file to begin using the default value found in the
conf/ directory's version.

To avoid this file's becoming out of date with the PAS for OE instance,
please refer to the the oeablSecurity.properties.README file found in the 
conf/ directory.
