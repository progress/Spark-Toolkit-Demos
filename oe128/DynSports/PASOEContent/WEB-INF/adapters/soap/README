This README describes contents of the parent folder "soap". The contents
of parent "soap" folder is used by the runtime to initialize SOAP transport
for the oeabl service. The layout of the rest folder containing a deployed
service e.g. <Service1>.paar will look like:

/soap
|
---- <Service1>
|    |
|    ---- <Service1>.soapoe
|    |
|    ---- <Service1>.wsdl
|
---- <Service2>

Deploying a WSM (Web Service Mapping) in an OEABL Appliction for PAS Server. 
===========================================================================

The WSM maps the Progress 4GL procedures that run on the Application Server.
Deployment of WSM can be performed using:

1) deploySOAP.sh/deploySOAP.bat utility:
   
   - The utility reside in the PAS instance's bin folder i.e. {CATALINA_BASE}/bin.
   
   - General syntax to deploy a wsm is:
     Examples:
       Deploy test.wsm to OEABL WebApp named ROOT
       # $CATALINA_BASE/bin/deploySOAP.sh /tmp/test.wsm ROOT

       Undeploy an existing SOAP service named test from OEABL WebApp ROOT
       # $CATALINA_BASE/bin/deploySOAP.sh test ROOT -undeploy
   
   - While using the utility ensure that the SOAP transport is ENABLED for the 
     target OEABL Service
   
   - Once deployed, the above mentioned files [.props, .wsad, .wsdl] will be 
     created in the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/<OEABL WebApp>/WEB-INF/adapters/soap 
     

2) REST webservice call to oemanager webapp:

   - oemanager webapp serves as a central utility to manage OEABL webapps.

   - General syntax to deploy a wsm is:
     Examples: ( using curl client. You may wish to use any HTTP client )
       Deploy test.wsm to OEABL WebApp named ROOT
        # curl -X POST --data-binary @test.wsm 
        # http://<PASHostName>:<PASPortNum>/oemanager/applications/<InstanceName>/webapps/ROOT/transports/soap/oeservices
        # -H "Accept: application/vnd.progress+json" 
        # -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.progress.wsm+xml" 
        # -H "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=test.wsm" -v 

       Undeploy an existing SOAP service named test from OEABL WebApp ROOT
        # curl -X POST
        # http://<PASHostName>:<PASPortNum>/oemanager/applications/<InstanceName>/webapps/ROOT/transports/soap/oeservices/test
   
   - While using the utility ensure that the SOAP transport is ENABLED for the 
     target OEABL Service
   
   - Once deployed, the above mentioned files [.soapoe, .wsdl] will be 
     created in the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/<OEABL WebApp>/WEB-INF/adapters/soap/<Service> directory
